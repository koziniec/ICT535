# Welcome to ICT535

This is a temporary site while we figure out why the LMS instance in semester 2 is not visible.

## Unit Guide

[ICT535-Unit-Guide-2021-S2]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/ICT535-Unit-Guide-2021-S2.pdf %})

## Week 1 content lecture

[ICT535-Lecture-1 Video]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/ICT535-Lecture-1-low.mp4 %})<br>
[ICT535-Lecture-1 Theory Slides]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/ICT535-2021-S1-Lecture-1-slides-Theory.pdf %})

Note that I will run through the administrative and assessment components in an "admin" lecture at the beginning of the workshop.<br>

## Week 1 readings
If you don't have access to the Cisco Networking Academy content yet you will today.

We will start with the curriculum ICT535-202x SRWE (Switching, Routing, and Wireless Essentials)

Read chapters 2 and 14 (Switching and Routing)
- Try to read generally and appreciate the big picture.
- Try to build a mental image how a network consists of layer 2 and layer 3 protocols and devices and how these work together.
- Access these via your Cisco Netacad account: http://cisco.netacad.com


## Week 1 labs
In general you need to watch the prerecorded "content lecture" and read the Cisco Curriculum before attending the lab sessions.  For week 1 this is less important but in future the labs will be closely tied to the theory.

Note, the workshop presentation will only cover the admin side of ICT535 and an introduction to lab activities.
